# ABSTRACT: policies that let you slide on common exceptions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Perl-Critic-Lax distribution includes versions of core Perl::Critic modules
with built-in exceptions.  If you really like a Perl::Critic policy, but find
that you often violate it in a specific way that seems pretty darn reasonable,
maybe there's a Lax policy.  If there isn't, send one in!
